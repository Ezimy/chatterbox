Chatterbox is a real-time chat application built with React and Firebase. The initial version of this app was created by following a tutorial by Llama Dev https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=domt_Sx-wTY. While adhering to the core structure provided by the tutorial, I made several enhancements and introduced new features to improve the overall functionality and user experience.
This project has been a great learning experience, and I continue to improve and expand upon it.
